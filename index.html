    <!-- About -->
    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Shajibur Rahman Bappy, a dedicated and detail-oriented Web Developer with a strong passion for building
            modern, responsive, and interactive websites. With a solid foundation in front-end and back-end
            technologies, I specialize in crafting digital experiences that are not only visually appealing but also
            optimized for performance and usability.

            My technical skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS on the front-end,
            and Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and MySQL on the back-end. I have hands-on experience building full-stack
            applications and dynamic web interfaces that adapt seamlessly across all devices.

            Throughout my journey as a developer, I’ve worked on a variety of personal and collaborative projects,
            including portfolios, calculators, form applications, eCommerce interfaces, and responsive landing pages.
            Some of my notable projects include Lumithub, Tea House, Donate Today, and several others — all designed to
            improve user interaction and deliver clean, efficient web solutions.

            I strongly believe in writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices in web development. I
            enjoy problem-solving, debugging, and continuously learning new tools and frameworks to stay up to date with
            the ever-evolving tech industry.

            Whether working independently or as part of a team, I always aim to deliver high-quality work that meets
            both user needs and business goals. My goal is to continue growing as a web developer, take on challenging
            projects, and contribute meaningfully to impactful web solutions.

            Let’s build something great together!</p>
